# Pipelined RISC Processor in VHDL

This project was done in a team of four people, to implement a six-stage single-cycle RISC processor in VHDL, with the ISA described in Problem_statement.pdf. 
We also implemented a branch predictor and hazard detection as part of the processor, with the report PDF providing additional details on the implementation of individual stages.
